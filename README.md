# Chess in Java
This is a Java project for a chess game, implemented using object-oriented programming concepts. Chess is one of the most popular and challenging board games, and this implementation allows players to enjoy the game directly in the terminal.

# Features
- Valid Moves: The implementation includes all the rules for piece movement according to the chess game rules.
- Piece Capture: The game allows pieces to capture opponent pieces, following the rules of the game.
- Check and Checkmate: The game detects when a player is in check and also when checkmate occurs.
- Pawn Promotion: If a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it can be promoted to another piece (e.g., queen, rook, bishop, or knight).

# Usage
To play the chess game, follow these steps:

1. Compile the Java source files.
2. Run the compiled Java program.
3. The game will prompt the players to enter their moves in the format "[source position] [destination position]" (e.g., "e2 e4").
4. Continue taking turns and following the prompts until the game ends.

Implement castling and en passant moves.
- Add graphical user interface (GUI) for a more visually appealing gameplay experience.
- Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
- Add support for saving and loading games.
- Implement a timer to track the duration of each player's moves.
